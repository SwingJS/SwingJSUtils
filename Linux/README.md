# Linux Scripts
### By the SwingJS Team

------------
## To Install

```
./install-linux [OPTIONAL] desired/installation/path
```

If no path is supplied, the script will install Eclipse into the same directory as the location of the `install-linux` script.

------------
## Clean Install

```
./clean-unix [OPTIONAL] location/of/eclipse/installation [REQUIRED] location/of/eclipse/workspace [REQUIRED] location/of/SwingJS/ant/build.xml
```

If no path is supplied, the script will assume location of the eclipse installation is in the same directory as the clean script.
